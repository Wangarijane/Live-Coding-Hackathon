## Prompts Used

"Claude, write a detailed and modular prompt for Bolt.new that will guide it to build a Loyalty Rewards App for local salons, barbershops, and eateries. Here‚Äôs what I want it to include:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Database Setup:
* A Customers table with fields: id, phone_number, visit_count, last_visit_date, reward_status.
* A Rewards table with fields: id, customer_id, reward_type, reward_message, issued_date.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Backend Logic:
* Workflow to add a new visit when a customer‚Äôs phone number is entered.
* Increment visit_count by 1 and update last_visit_date.
* Check if the visit_count matches a reward threshold (e.g., 5 visits). If yes, create a record in the Rewards table and prepare a reward message.
* Optional: Allow configurable reward tiers (e.g., 5 visits = 10% discount, 10 visits = free service).
3Ô∏è‚É£ Notification Integration:
* Integrate with Twilio or WhatsApp Cloud API to send the reward message (e.g., ‚ÄòCongrats! You‚Äôve earned a 10% discount.‚Äô).
* Allow fallback to email or in-app notification if phone number is invalid.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend Design:
* Create a simple, mobile-friendly web app interface.
* Include a dashboard for the business owner showing total customers, visit counts, rewards issued.
* Allow searching customers by phone number and viewing their reward history.
* Provide error handling and success confirmations for each action.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Security & Scalability:
* Ensure secure handling of phone numbers and rewards.
* Design with modular workflows for easy updates (e.g., adding new reward types or analytics).
Output a clear, complete prompt I can paste into Bolt.new to automatically build this app, with tables, workflows, and API integrations specified.
Also suggest AI-generated reward messages (e.g., ‚ÄòThank you for your loyalty!‚Äô) for the SMS or WhatsApp notifications."
